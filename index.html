    <h2>First Lego Legue</h2>
    <div class="underline"></div>
    <p>Tomorrow’s innovators practice imaginative thinking and teamwork. Guided by Coaches, FIRST LEGO League* teams (up to 10 members, ages 9 to 14) research a real-world problem such as food safety, recycling, energy, etc., and are challenged to develop a solution. They also must design, build, program a robot using LEGO MINDSTORMS®, then compete on a table-top playing field</p>
    <p>It all adds up to tons of fun while they learn to apply science, technology, engineering, and math concepts (STEM), plus a big dose of imagination, to solve a problem. Along their journey, they develop critical thinking and team-building skills, basic STEM applications, and even presentation skills, as they must present their solutions with a dash of creativity to judges. They also practice the Program’s Core Values, which emphasize discovery, teamwork and good sportsmanship.
    </p>
    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>Proven, verifiable impact! FIRST LEGO League’s positive impact on participants is gratifying and well documented. Over 87% are more interested in doing well in school, and 88% have more interest in attending college.</p>
